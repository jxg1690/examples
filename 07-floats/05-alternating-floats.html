        A popular use of floats might be to do a kind of gallery where
        the image floats to one side of a caption, then alternates.

        In order for this to work, it is necessary to enclose the
        element being floated and the text. But this also causes the
        floated element to make the container around it collapse. (The
        notes and the css file get into this.)

        Notice here's a use case of two class values - - remember,
        classes can have multiple values separated by a space. There is
        one which just handles eliminating the container collapse and
        one for clearing the float.
