      Note there is no 'id' here - - this will take our general styles
      for all the content within. It's best to determine which pages
      will share the same qualities and style those to use type
      selectors (i.e. header, main, section, etc.), then identify the
      page(s) which will be different, give them an id and style them
      differently in the stylesheet.
