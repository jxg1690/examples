    <h1>HTML5 Audio</h1>

    <!--
      IMPORTANT! As with all other media, be sure you have the rights
      to use the audio file!


      Details about <audio> can be found at:

      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio

      You also want to read about audio formats supported by browsers:

      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Supported_media_formats

      For this course, getting it working is the goal. If you keep
      the web site and want to improve it, adding a (backup) format
      like .ogg is a good idea.


      NOTES:

      - If you only have one source file, use the first example.
        If/when you include backup formats, use the second.

      - Modern browsers do support HTML5 audio, and most people use
        modern browsers. However, you still want to add the message in
        case a user visiting the site is on a very old computer.

      - NEVER add the autoplay option. NEVER. Autoplay annoys people.

      - Make sure to add controls so a user can adjust volume,
        pause/resume playing, seek to a specific point in the audio.

      - At a minimum, consider preloading the metadata information
        (i.e. length of song) with the 'preload="metadata"' attribute
        and value. You may want to preload the full file if the size
        is not unreasonable. Think of it in the same context of an
        image: you don't want to eat up (mobile) data plans if the
        file size is greater than 1MB. (In this example, cat-meow.mp3
        is only 27k; preload here would be okay.)

      - <audio> is an inline element, so if you need to adjust
        placement for your design, you may change it to a block. (See
        styles above.)

    <!-- Basic setup (one source file): -->

    <audio src="audio/cat-meow.mp3" controls="controls" preload="metadata">
      <p>Your browser does not support <strong>HTML5 audio</strong>. Why not download a <a href="https://browsehappy.com/">web browser</a> which does?</p>

    <!--
      Multiple source files:
    -->

    <audio controls="controls" preload="metadata">
      <source src="audio/cat-meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
      <!-- <source src="audio/cat-meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg" /> -->
