      EMBEDDING YOUTUBE VIDEO

      1. When embedding a YouTube video, click 'Share' (it is next to
         the thumbs up/thumbs down part.

      2. Next, click 'Embed'. This brings up a special window. At the
         very top, you'll see a chunk of code (<iframe>). This is what
         you will eventually embed, but there are some options to fix.

      3. If you need/want the video to start at a specific point (maybe
         it is a 10-minute video and your part begins 7 minutes in),
         check 'Start at' and note the starting time.

      4. You can now copy <iframe></iframe> (and all the attributes)
         and paste it into your html.

      ...

      When you embed a web video you should take your design into
      account when determining the size. By default YouTube uses a
      width of 560 px.

      What if you have a design that allows you to put a pretty big
      video - - 960px - - into your page? You should take advantage of
      that. Allow your user to solely focus on your video; that is what
      you want them to do in the case of a portfolio. :)

      To make your video fit your design, you'll need to do a simple
      proportion. (Math, sorry. YouTube *used* to include a feature
      which handled this for you but...). Using a width of 960px as an
      example...

      560px   960px
      ===== = =====
      315px     x

      We cross-multiply: (315 * 960) = 560x

      Then divide by 560 in this case.  302,400 / 560 = x

      The value of x (the height of the video) is 540px.

      ...

      Within the <iframe> tag, you will see width and height
      attributes. Use the values from your calculation to change the
      size of the video:

      <iframe width="960" height="540" ...

      Again, the video can be adjusted to any size to fit your design.
      You just have to figure out the proportion.
