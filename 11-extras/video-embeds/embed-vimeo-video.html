      EMBEDDING VIMEO VIDEO

      1. When embedding a Vimeo video, click on the paper airplane icon
         in the top, right corner of the video. It will reveal a
         'share' tab.

      2. To the right of the 'Embed' heading, click '+Show options'.

      3. Under 'Intro', uncheck 'Portrait', 'Title' and 'Byline'.

      4. Under 'Special Stuff', all items should be unchecked.

      5. If you need to re-size your video (see below), enter the
         desired width in the first box next to 'Size'. This will
         automatically calculate the hight (displayed in the second
         box), keeping your video proportional.

      6. When finished, click '-Hide options'. There's a form field
         which contains the code you will need to embed just below
         (everything between <iframe></iframe>). Click this, and the
         code will highlight. Copy and paste into your web page.

      RE-SIZING VIDEO

      When you embed a web video you should take your design into
      account when determining the size. By default YouTube uses a
      width of 560 px.

      What if you have a design that allows you to put a pretty big
      video - - 960px - - into your page? You should take advantage of
      that. Allow your user to solely focus on your video; that is what
      you want them to do in the case of a portfolio. :)

      SUGGESTIONS

      When embedding a video, don't be lazy and use Vimeo's content. Use a heading in your design! You have control over the style, content, etc.

      Also, it can be good user experience to provide context of what is in that video. Just seeing an image isn't going to entice someone to watch. Provide a short description or teaser.
