      <h1>Box Model Example</h1>

      <p>If you open up Firefox Web Developer Tools, you can see how the box model works using this page as an example.</p>

      <p>In the inspector, <strong>content appears in blue</strong>; <strong>padding appearrs in purple</strong>; <strong>border appears in gray</strong> (although you should be able to see the border since a width must be specified); and <strong>margin appears in yellow</strong>.</p>

      <p>The content is variable in size. The <code>div</code> should have 20 pixels of padding on each side, a 5-pixel gray border on each side and a 30-pixel margin on each side.</p>
